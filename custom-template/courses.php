                            <p>This course is aimed at managers and staff in all industries who play a role in reducing drug, alcohol and substance misuse in the UK.</p>
                            <p>The course starts with official statistics to illustrate the scale of drug and alcohol abuse in the UK. You'll learn in detail about commonly used drugs, including cannabis, cocaine, heroin, LSD, ecstasy and some new designer drugs.</p>

                            <h4>Positive Handling in Schools</h4>
                            <p>Positive Handling is a very serious subject. Knowing when and how to act in a difficult situation can be the difference between a positive outcome and a potentially career ending prosecution. This course will start by looking at some examples and statistics which highlight the seriousness and extent of aggressive pupil behaviour, it will then go on to explain how you can identify the stages of aggression and provide some tips on how you could de-escalate a pupil before they lash out. It also looks at where the law stands on this subject and finally best practice in theory if you ever do need to restrain a pupil.</p>

                            <h4>Prevent Duty</h4>
                            <p>Intelligence indicates that further terrorist attacks in our country are ‘highly likely’.</p>
                            <p>Experience tells us that the threat comes not just from foreign nationals, but from terrorists born and bred in Britain. It is therefore vital that our counter-terrorism strategy contains a plan to prevent radicalisation and stop would-be terrorists from committing mass murder. The Prevent strategy, published by the Government is part of the overall counter-terrorism strategy.
                                This course starts with an overview of the Government’s Prevent strategy, and then looks at some of the reasons people become extremists. It goes on to cover the objectives of the Prevent strategy, how to base your actions on a risk based approach, what to do if you are concerned and much more.</p>

                            <h4>Safeguarding Adults</h4>
                            <p>Our Safeguarding courses have been created because, first and foremost, each and every one of us has basic human rights. Chief among these is the right to be healthy, happy and treated well, regardless of race, age, gender or location. When these rights are abused in some way it’s wrong, and it is therefore vital that guidelines, policies and procedures are followed to enable everyone, without exception to live a life in which these basic values and rights are maintained and upheld.</p>
                            <p>This course is aimed at anyone who has a duty of care for, or comes into contact with, adults in need of care and support, either as a paid professional or a volunteer. This includes, but isn’t limited to, those that work in domiciliary care, the NHS, community centres, prisons or with a family member at home, and sets out the roles and responsibilities everyone must undertake to protect an adult’s right to live in safety, free from abuse and neglect. You and the organisation you work for must take appropriate and proportional measures necessary for the protection of adults in your care, while still ensuring they are supported and empowered to have control over how they want to live their lives and this course can bring you one step closer to being able to do this.</p>
